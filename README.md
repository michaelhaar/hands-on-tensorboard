# Installation

## Requirements
Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

## pip
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## conda Environments
You can find Conda environment files for this project in the ``environments`` folder.
Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with ``tensorflow-gpu`` are labeled in the filename with "GPU".

To create an environment from an environment file use ``conda env create -f environment.yaml``. 
This will create a new environment with the same name listed in ``environment.yaml`` file.
